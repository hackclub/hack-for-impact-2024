# ðŸŒ€ Hack for Impact (Berkeley, 2024)

Here's everything hackers at Hack for Impact need to know about The Hack Foundation &amp; HCB.

We give nonprofits the financial tools they need to make an impact and maintain transparent finances.  

The Hack Foundation provides fiscal sponsorship through a custom-built platform called HCB ([https://hackclub.com/hcb](https://hackclub.com/hcb)). On HCB, organisations can raise money through invoices, donations, bank transfers etc. and then spend it using cards we issue.Â 

At the core of it, weâ€™re a nonprofit that builds software! Thereâ€™s about a half a dozen engineers working on HCB at the moment; @sampoder is one of them, heâ€™s a student here at Berkeley / Cal Hacks organiser and is at Hack for Impact today so give him a shout if you need any help. At the moment, weâ€™re working towards open sourcing the entire platform. Thus far, [weâ€™ve open sourced small pieces of it](https://github.com/hackclub/?q=hcb&type=all&language=&sort=). We hope to soon open source the main Ruby on Rails codebase.

We have an API for hackers to use public data in their projects: [https://hcb.hackclub.com/docs/api/v3/](https://hcb.hackclub.com/docs/api/v3/).

**Problem Statements**

***1) Data visualisation of transparent organisations***

**Problem statement:** something (it could be a web app or it could be something totally different, get creative!) that provides you with a visual breakdown of how an organisation spent the money theyâ€™ve raised.

**Background:** on HCB, an organisation can choose to make their finances publicly available through Transparency Mode. These finances can then be accessed through the API.

**Goal:** reading a long list of transactions is time consuming, a user should be able to get a rough understanding of an organisationâ€™s finances in a few minutes using your product.

**Key features:** changes to an organisationâ€™s account balance overtime, categorised spending using tags, spending by user.

**Stuck?** Here are some ideas to get you started: what are some novel formats you could use? What if you programmed a video using Remotion? What would a GitHub commit graph look like if it was for a nonprofitâ€™s finances?

***2) Budgeting tool for events that is transparent***

**Problem statement:** a tool that allows organisations to create a budget and then open-source it. Similar to how organisations can open source their spending using HCB, itâ€™d be nice for them to be able to open source their budget.

**Background:** a lot of hackathons are organised using HCB. These hackathons like to open source their budgets (eg. Lion City Hacks & Assemble), however, the best tool they have at the moment to do that is Google Sheets.

**Goal:** teams should be able to collaborate on budget and then have a public view of that budget. A stretch goal would be an integration with HCBâ€™s API.

**Key features:** assigning amounts to spending categories, having sub categories, and having charts that visualise the budget.

***3) Machine learning to tag transactions.***

**Problem statement:** a machine learning model that can suggest tags for a transaction based on its memo and any other information available from the API.

**Background:** on HCB, users can add tags to transactions. However, for large organisations this can take a lot of time.Â 

**Goal:** speed up the process of transaction tagging by having suggested tags there for users.Â 

**Key features:** ideally any solution would be implemented in Ruby but weâ€™re flexible so use whatâ€™s most comfortable to you!

***4) Open Ended***

Got a project in mind related to the HCB API or financial transparency? Weâ€™d love to see it come to life! Feel free to venture outside of our three problem statements. Scratch thatâ€¦ youâ€™re encouraged to do something different.
